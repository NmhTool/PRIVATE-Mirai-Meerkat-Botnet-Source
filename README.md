# PRIVATE-Mirai-Meerkat-Botnet-Source
A Mirai type botnet called "Meerkat" very known in the community. Methods include basic TCP flags, L7, OVH, UDPRAW &amp; UDP, XMAS, STD, &amp; GRE methods. What you'll love about this botnet are the tools like; WHOIS, IP pinger, ASN lookup, &amp; etc. I do not condone any DDoS attacks or promote it.
